# TesseractIndic
The aim of this project is to add Indic script support to the Tesseract OCR engine, which currently does not support connected script such as in Malayalam. This includes adding some routines to the existing code base, training the engine with sample images and then testing for accuracy for subsequent debugging and refinement in the algorithms.
